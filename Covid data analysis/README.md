# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves a multi-faceted analysis of COVID-19 data, divided into two key components:

### SQL Data Exploration
- Conducted extensive SQL queries using SQL Server to explore and analyze COVID-19 data, including trends, infection rates, and vaccination coverage.
- Created views, utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and temporary tables to perform advanced calculations and aggregations.
- Employed joins and aggregate functions to derive metrics such as death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination coverage.

### Tableau Visualization
- Designed and developed interactive visualizations and dashboards to present COVID-19 data insights by importing SQL query results into Tableau.
- Utilized various Tableau visualization tools to create charts, graphs, and dashboards that highlight key data trends and metrics.

## Installation

1. **SQL Server**: Required for executing SQL queries.
2. **Tableau**: Needed for visualization tasks.

## Usage

### SQL Data Exploration
- Run SQL queries to explore data and derive insights.

### Tableau Visualization
- Load SQL results into Tableau to create and interact with dashboards.
