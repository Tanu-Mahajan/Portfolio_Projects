# Road Accident Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to analyze road accident data, focusing on various key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. The dashboard provides insights into total casualties, accident severity, vehicle types, and location-based statistics for effective decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Primary KPIs**: Total casualties and accidents for the current year, along with year-over-year growth; casualties by accident severity.
- **Secondary KPIs**: Total casualties by vehicle type for the current year.
- **Monthly Trend**: Comparison of casualties between the current year and the previous year.
- **Casualties by Road Type**: Analysis of casualties based on road types for the current year.
- **Location-Based Analysis**: Casualties by area/location, and day/night for the current year.
- **Total Casualties and Accidents by Location**: Breakdown of total casualties and accidents by specific locations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **PowerBI**: For dashboard design, data visualization, and KPI generation.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive charts, filters, sparklines, and additional KPIs.
- **SQL**: For querying and processing data, and validating results against dashboards.

## Steps
1. **Raw Data Overview**: Initial exploration and understanding of the data.
2. **Connecting Data**: Integration of data sources with PowerBI.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Utilizing Power Query for data preparation.
4. **Data Processing**: Implementing time intelligence functions and data modeling.
5. **Data Visualization**: Creating charts, custom measures, and exporting reports.
6. **Validation**: Comparing and validating results across Tableau and PowerBI dashboards.
