**Cellular Charity - Mobile Donation Platform**

Overview

Problem:
Despite the widespread use of smartphones, many marginalized communities still lack access to the digital world, limiting their opportunities for education, employment, and communication. Mobile donation drives aim to bridge this digital divide and empower these communities.

Proposed solution:
Mobile Donation Platform is an application that facilitates device donations, allowing individuals, universities, and companies to contribute their smartphones. The donated devices undergo quality checks and are distributed to individuals and organizations in need.

Process Flow:
Central Hub: Collects and categorizes donated phones, updating inventory and directing devices to retail outlets or the Inspection Hub for quality checks.
Inspection Hub: Assesses device quality, refurbishes functional devices, and sends them for distribution; directs unusable devices to the Scrap Hub.
Scrap Hub: Ensures proper disposal and recycling of unusable devices to promote sustainable practices.
Logistics Hub: Manages the transportation of devices between hubs and to recipients.

Key Roles:
Retail Manager - Oversees distribution at retail outlets.
Donor - Contributes mobile devices.
Operations Manager - Manages day-to-day operations.
Inventory Manager - Manages device inventory.
Quality Assurance Manager - Oversees device assessments.
Technician - Refurbishes and repairs functional devices.
Scrap Manager - Manages the Scrap Hub and device recycling.
Logistics Manager - Oversees the transportation of devices.
Driver - Transports devices between hubs and distribution points
