# Movie Analysis Project

This project involves data analysis on a dataset of movies to explore the relationships between various features such as budget, gross earnings, and other attributes. The analysis is performed using Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Data Analysis Steps
- **Import Libraries**: Load the necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Load Data**: Read the dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
- **Check for Missing Data**: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Drop rows with missing values and correct data types.
- **Data Exploration**: Sort and analyze the dataset based on specific features.

## Visualizations
- **Budget vs Gross Earnings**: A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between budget and gross earnings of movies.
- **Regression Plot**: A regression plot showing the linear relationship between budget and gross earnings.
- **Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap to visualize the correlations among numerical features.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that votes and budget have a strong correlation with gross earnings, while the production company shows low correlation.
